User Story
    A user will be able to input a noun, verb, or adjective based on the game's prompt. After processing these inputs, the computer will output a complete story by filling in designated blank spaces with the user's specified words.

What I need?
    1. Story Template (probably a string)
    2. Blank spaces (Objects? something to manage these)
    3. Prompt for user's input, must specify part of speech
    4. Generate complete story
    5. Display complete story

Code requirements
    -Variable assignment
    -Function definitions
    -Core data types: strings, integers, floats
    -Collection types: lists, tuples, dictionary

Stretch Challenges
    -Randomize the words of the same type (ie shuffle the 5 nouns)).
    -Use a dictionary to generate the words.
    -Use a different data structure to store words.
    -Build with TDD
    -Use the system module (for accessing command-line arguments)
