# Mad Libs
Mad Libs is a template word game where players replace blank spaces in a short story with random words.
 
 ```
 "_____________! he said ________ as he jumped into his convertible
   exclamation            adverb
      
  ______ and drove off with his ___________ kitten."
   noun                          adjective
   ```

## User Stories
As a user, I'll be prompted to enter a noun, verb, or adjective. After the program processes my inputs, I'll be able to view a complete story that features my words in designated places throughout.

## Code requirements
- Variable assignments
- Function definitions
- Core data types: strings, integers, floats
- Collection types: lists, tuples, dictionary


## Stretch Challenges
- Randomize words of the same type (ie shuffle the 5 nouns)).
- Use a dictionary to generate the words.
- Use a different data structure to store words.
- Use the system module (for accessing command-line arguments)
- Build with TDD
